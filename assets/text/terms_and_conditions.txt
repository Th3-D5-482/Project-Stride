• Sessions delayed or disrupted due to circumstances beyond the trainer’s control (e.g., natural disasters, pandemics, government restrictions) will be rescheduled where possible, but refunds will not be provided.

• If the trainer cancels, the session will be rescheduled without cost.

• Public holiday sessions will be paused or rescheduled unless agreed otherwise.

• Validity begins from the date of the first scheduled session, not the purchase date.
